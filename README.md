# Querying-A-Music-Stores-Database

This project involved a Chinook Database (provided). The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. 

This project is about assisting the Chinook team with understanding the following:

- which companies spent the most on songs
- which artists earned the most from their songs as it pertained to purchases made in Canada
- which genre earned the most revenue in each country
- for each genre, how much the top-spending customer spent on music
